# Alterior Quickstart

This is a quickstart app to demonstrate how to use the [Alterior](https://github.com/alterior-mvc/alterior) server-side MVC framework to build a basic REST API.
To get started, you'll need to install Typescript 1.8 or newer globally.

```
npm i typescript -g
```

Start the app with:

```
npm start
```

You can build the app with:

```
npm run build
```

You can run the included sample Mocha unit tests with:

```

```

You can run a continuous-watcher for unit tests during development:

```
npm run dev-test
```
